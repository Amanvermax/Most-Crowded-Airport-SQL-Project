## Introduction

Air travel is a crucial part of global transportation. This project aims to analyze passenger data to identify the most crowded airports from 2016 to 2020, providing insights into trends in air travel during this period.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset with the following metadata:

- Ranks
- Year
- Airport
- Location
- Country
- Code
- Passengers
- Male
- Female
- Economy_class
- Business_class
- Age_above_50
- Age_below_50

## Queries

This project includes a collection of SQL queries to extract useful information from the dataset. Here are some examples:

1. Find the country with the most passengers in the year 2018.
2. Find the top 5 airports with the highest gender diversity
(lowest ratio of male to female passengers) in the year 2017.
3. Calculate the percentage change in the number of passengers
 for each airport from 2016 to 2022.
4. [Retrieve the airport with the highest number of passengers for each year.
5. [Calculate the total passengers in economy class and business class in 2020](queries/total_passengers_2020.sql)
  and many more.....
